# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## What I did in milestone 2:
created list of guesses, did an example of user input

## Okay sorry I haven't added lots of detail for the readme because it's boring and the project is really simple anyway.
I promise I would if it was a real project. For the other projects, which are more complicated, I will endeavour to do better.
