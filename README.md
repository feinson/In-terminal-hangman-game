# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

I promise I would if it was a real project. For the other projects, which are more complicated, I will endeavour to do better.
